You can't call yourself a true nerd if you don't know at least two Klingon words.<br>
A few years ago, on my way back from STICON, the Italian Star Trek fandom convention, I thought about how rusty my Klingon was.<br>
In the 90s, I had studied it with the help of a nice interactive CD-ROM, but over time I had lost familiarity with it and almost forgot it.<br>
The "Klingon Language Lab" was a CD-ROM paired with the game "Star Trek Klingon" released in 1996, where thanks to the help of the very friendly chancellor of the Klingon High Council Gowron, you could observe the setting, listen to the pronunciation and, what is incredible, practice speaking it.<br>
In fact, within this software there was an advanced (for the time) speech recognition system that allowed the computer to check your pronunciation as with a real teacher.<br>
It would have been useful to be able to use it again and refresh my Klingon a bit in view of the next convention, but unfortunately it was only compatible with Windows 95, which made it impractical, especially if you want to study two words of Klingon in the free time, at lunch break or in the office while you pretend to work.<br>
And so, for necessity and fun, I decided, using the multimedia content already present on the CD-ROM, to rewrite it completely in Real Basic for Mac Osx.<br>

During the lock-down I happened to find it in an old backup and so I thought I'd share it with all those who, out of necessity or for fun, want to "refresh" a bit of Klingon.<br>
